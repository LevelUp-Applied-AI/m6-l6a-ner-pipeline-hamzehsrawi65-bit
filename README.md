# Lab 6A — NER Pipeline

Module 6 Week A lab for AI.SPIRE Applied AI & ML Systems.

Build and compare Named Entity Recognition (NER) pipelines using spaCy and Hugging Face on climate-related text data.

## Setup

```bash
pip install torch --index-url https://download.pytorch.org/whl/cpu
pip install -r requirements.txt
python -m spacy download en_core_web_sm
```

The Hugging Face NER pipeline runs on PyTorch; we install the CPU wheel explicitly so the download stays small. `requirements.txt` intentionally omits `torch`. The spaCy model download is ~12 MB. The first run of the HF NER model will download ~250 MB of model weights — this is a one-time download.

## Tasks

Complete the seven functions in `ner_pipeline.py`:
1. `load_data(filepath)` — Load the climate articles dataset
2. `explore_data(df)` — Return a summary dict (shape, language/category counts, text length stats)
3. `preprocess_text(text, nlp)` — NFC-normalize and return lowercased lemmas using the injected spaCy pipeline
4. `extract_spacy_entities(df, nlp)` — Extract entities using spaCy NER
5. `extract_hf_entities(df, ner_pipeline)` — Extract entities using Hugging Face NER (merge `##` subwords and strip `B-`/`I-` IOB prefix)
6. `compare_ner_outputs(spacy_df, hf_df)` — Entity counts per system plus `both`/`spacy_only`/`hf_only` overlap sets
7. `evaluate_ner(predicted_df, gold_df)` — Compute entity-level precision, recall, F1

## Submission

1. Create a branch: `lab-6a-ner-pipeline`
2. Complete `ner_pipeline.py`
3. Open a PR to `main`
4. Paste your PR URL into TalentLMS → Module 6 Week A → Lab 6A
